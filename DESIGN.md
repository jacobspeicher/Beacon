### The Ship
- Light illuminating from the inside of the ship
- Lands on planet at the end of each level

### Planetside
- Person that will give you upgrades
- Dictator motivated to stop the supply runs to the planet
- See environments for where dictator is typing out story and where people are living
- Multiple people on the surface that you interact with
- Can exit ship but no player control of where pilot goes or who they talk to

### New Design
- One person on the planet
- Somehow make it about loneliness
- Why doesn't the guy leave the planet? He's looking for something.
- Why doesn't the pilot take him away? The guy needs to find something.
- Have story be told through this guy, and be missions to find the device to turn on the beacons
  - This is when the Beacons get placed for the next level
- Guy is traveling around the planet to find something, that's why you need multiple routes through
  the atmosphere and one setup of beacons doesn't work
- Everything in orbit is out of phase, but in the proximity phases back in, and then you hit it
- Beacons bring things back into phase so they're visible
- Things on the planet are drifting out of phase as well.
- The guy is looking for a way to bring everything out of phase back into our universe
- Platforming?
- Titan Souls-esque?
