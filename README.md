# Beacon
new and improved version of beacon, now editable cross platform

Beacon is a game I made for a game jam in two weeks. One of my first games using Godot Engine, and GDScript. As the player, you place "beacons" around junk in space surrounding a planet. All junk that is not within range of the beacons becomes invisible, so you must plan your route through the field to make it to the planet. The second part of gameplay is actually flying the ship through this field.

Unfortunately, work on this updated, hopefully-more-enjoyable-to-play version has kind of stalled. I do plan on picking it back up eventually though.
