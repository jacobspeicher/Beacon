# Story

## Scene 1
- Everyone remembers the old stories.
- Once a grand spacefaring civilization, with luxuries and an empire that spread galaxies.
- That all changed when the Event happened.

## Scene 2
- Long ago the planet shook and warped, transforming into what it is today.
- Barren, unturning, and either molten hot, or despairingly cold.
- This is our home.
- That was the Event.

## Scene 3
- Our people lost their sanity.
- Civil War broke out, and it seemed we were lost.
- We were saved by the spheres.

## Scene 4
- We called them Eden spheres.
- For a time, we could power them with geothermal energy, but our home eventually cooled.
- We attempted to create solar farms on the Far Side, but dangerous radiation prevented that.

## Scene 5
- So made contact with the last of our old allies.
- They agreed to send us resources to help us continue.
- Their only demand was that we light their way.

## Scene 6
- After the Event, we could no longer afford to return to space.
- Satellites deteriorated, broke apart. All the junk we used long ago was now a danger.
 
## Scene 7
- The first ships couldn't make it through.
- We watched in dismay as their wrecks only added to the shield.
- Over time they developed better technologies, and we developed the beacons.

## Scene 8
- We called them the Light Receivers.
- They followed the beacons through the darkness.

## Scene 9
- My people still hold hope there will be an end to this.
- As their leader, I must hide the truth from them.
- The engineers, the scientists, they left us long ago.
- Our machines are failing.

## Scene 10a
- It's time to stop this pretense.
- The Eden spheres are failing.
- I'm going to shut down the beacons.
- Our fate is already sealed.
- There are no more receivers coming.

## Scene 10b
- They came anyway.
- They're right. We can't destroy ourselves.
- I'm going to restore the Beacons.
