## Checklist

### Overall
- [ ] Escape always gives an escape menu or returns to main menu
- [ ] Escape (pause) menu should be in the middle of the screen
- [ ] Space and Enter do the same always (selection and whatnot)
- [ ] Actual lighting for beacons, not just detecting what junk is around them
- [ ] Crashing into beacons also a thing
- [ ] The beacons need to be placed into the path if the player wants a path that looks clear, so this adds an obstacle the player needs to add if they want to get through the junk
- [ ] Make ship smaller
- [ ] Make the game play more to the shadow element

### Planning Screen

- [ ] Pilot button on bottom right
- [ ] Move with arrow keys around planning area
- [ ] Move pick-up-able beacons from top left
- [ ] Space background

### Piloting Screen

- [ ] Background space detail (moving background of space)
- [ ] Allow stopping of movement to the right
- [ ] Clear line where the level ends
- [ ] Fix hitboxes
- [ ] Move ship to left side of the screen

### Main Menu Screen
- [ ] Detail of overhead junk orbiting a planet
- [x] Line to select menu items
- [x] Not 'steering' (piloting)
- [x] Mouse can also select menu options

### Story Screen
- [x] Enter can progress story (get rid of button)
- [ ] Copy over the story (or rewrite it, or whatever)
- [ ] Space/Enter, if held speed up test, if tapped, make the message appear

### Planetside
- [ ] People give you upgrades as the game progresses for your ship
- [ ] Last upgrade is lights for the outside of your ship to illuminate the area around you. As leader takes beacons away, the people give you a way to get through still.
